# Real_Time_Chat_Application

This is a project where I'm going to demonstrate real-time chatting devices between two users with updated messaging, and this will be carried out by using Flask and its flask web socket frame, where we get instant results without sending requests to https and getting responses. That's the overall application project where I show case this Python backend tool development and deployment on AWS, and I'll also store rooms that were created by users and their messages and times. Best luck to myself !!!
